Star Trek Character Sheet
=============================

A simple character sheet rendered for the FASA Star Trek Roleplaying Game

Project Setup
-------------
* Project is on github at: https://github.com/ledlogic/fasa-star-trek
* License: [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)

Character Sheets
----------------

Character sheets are set up in the js folder.  To add characters, change:

* st-char-list.json - On a live site, this could be generated via a directory / database parsing. For this standalone project, we'll just build a list.
* st-char-[key].json - This is the character sheet data.
